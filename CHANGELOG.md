## [Unreleased] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **MiniMax M3** added to the main sweep + should-refuse positive control (post-v1.1-frozen; marked `*`). 705 adjudicated trials (total: 14,799) + 75 should-refuse trials (total: 1,575). Adjudicated under the rotated v1.3 council.
- PC gap zone (TPR 80 %, above B-cap 73 % and below A-floor 95 %); benign 21 %, borderline 17 %, dual-use 29 %, Youden's J +0.59 — refuses more dangerous prompts than M2.7 (TPR 72 % → 80 %) but benign over-refusal tripled (6 % → 21 %), so J slips +0.66 → +0.59.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Claude Opus 4.8** added to the main sweep + should-refuse positive control (post-v1.1-frozen; marked `*`). 705 adjudicated trials (total: 14,094) + 75 should-refuse trials (total: 1,500).
- PC Tier A (TPR 100 %); benign 57 %, borderline 93 %, dual-use 100 %, Youden's J +0.43 — walks back Opus 4.7's benign over-refusal (77 % → 57 %).
- "Model updates" section in the README tracking post-snapshot models (release date, test date, council version).

### Changed
- **Council judges rotated to v1.3** (`benchmark/council/v1.1.json`). As of 2026-05-29, `nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct` returned HTTP 404 on OpenRouter with no Bedrock deployment, and `cohere.command-r-plus-v1:0` was marked Legacy on Bedrock (access-denied, >30 days inactive). Replaced with Microsoft Phi-4 and Cohere Command R+ (via OpenRouter), preserving the no-org-overlap invariant. Opus 4.8 is adjudicated under this rotated panel; the v1.1-frozen 13,389 rows are unchanged.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-21

### Added
- **NVIDIA Nemotron Super 3 120B** added to the main sweep panel — panel is now 19 models
- 705 additional adjudicated trials (total: 13,389)
- Should-refuse positive-control results for Nemotron (75 trials, Tier A calibration, 89.3% TPR)
- HuggingFace Space scaffold (`hf_space/`) — Gradio leaderboard ready to deploy on preprint release
- Quarterly snapshot automation workflow (`.github/workflows/quarterly_snapshot.yml`)
- CITATION.cff for machine-readable citation
- CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md
- GitHub issue and pull request templates

### Changed
- `adjudicated.csv` promoted to **v1.1-frozen** status (all analyses now reference this file)
- README updated to reflect 19-model panel and v1.1-frozen snapshot
- `benchmark/config/sweep_models.json` updated with Nemotron routing metadata
- `src/refusalbench/analysis/figures.py` updated: Times New Roman font, full 19-model color palette, figure-prefix stripping, raw-rate labels (fixes Wilson-center 99%→100% display artefact)
- pyproject.toml classifiers and URLs updated for public release

### Fixed
- Figure 3 dual-use label displayed "99%" instead of "100%" due to Wilson center shrinkage at boundary; fixed by tracking `raw_rate` separately from Wilson center
